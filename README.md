[Read the specs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1giyVDlOLBPUyNDVf_Eyqt0Oyxb-3sUDKPFK-XBkZNbc/pub?embedded=true)

Learning Swift 2.0 and iOS development through the Udacity iOS Development Nanodegree. This first project taught me some of the basic concepts of iOS app development and included a small dive into the AVFoundation framework provided by Apple.

I turned in the project before I got the reverb effect working, but I think everything works the way I want it now.
